/**
 * This file is to emulate the custom css mechanism during development.
 * A hosted app on CouchCommerce can have customer css injected. The customer
 * maintains the css via http://console.couchcommerce.com among with all
 * the other style settings of the app.
 *
 * A deployed app simply get's the customer css appended at the very bottom
 * of the css file.
 *
 * During development you sometimes may want to try out if a specifc
 * customization would be possible for the customer or not. This file
 * serves exactly this purpose. Just paste the css here to try out the
 * customization possibles the customer has.
 *
 * ATTENTION: Make sure to strictly stick to css in this file. The customer
 * CAN'T use scss via the console. Only css is allowed
 *
